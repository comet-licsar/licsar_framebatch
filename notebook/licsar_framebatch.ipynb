    "These instructions will help you performing frame processing using licsar_framebatch. It is based on LiCS Auto-Batch routines developed by Nick Greenall. Generally speaking, you will be able to perform whole LiCSAR processing chain on the frame you identify and will see the progress in the following Google Docs spreadsheet:  \n",

Note that all (huge) files will be generated and kept here and it is your responsibility to care of the groupwork space here (thank you for keeping things tidy).  \n",
